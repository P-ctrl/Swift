                    Swift Interactive is a video game development studio located in Boden, Sweden. The studio was founded in January 2020 and they started official development on their first game in June 2020.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pt-5 text-light text-center">HISTORY</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">The team that would eventually become Swift Interactive assembled in anticipation of the third digital game project as a part of the FutureGames Indie development education. The director Dennis Löfgren had the idea for a 3D platformer that went back to the roots of the genre. He started conversations with his classmates in hopes of creating a team willing to make this game. He joined forces with artist Jessica Mattila and started initial development of the plot and the main character, Cara. 

                    Most of the team was assembled months to days ahead of the project start. This includes lead programmer Leo Alkberg, lead artist Liridon Imeri and level designer Carl Stengård. The final two members, programmer Joakim Börjesson and technical artist Vincent Schubbert joined the project when the class was being split into groups.
                    
                    The prototype for Cara started development on October 14, 2019 using Unreal Engine. Development kept going for 10 weeks in anticipation for the presentation in front of a jury of industry professionals. Dennis and Leo presented the game together and the pitch was received very well, gaining massive praise. It was named one of the best student presentations ever heard by one of the jury members and multiple questions and opportunities were raised about bringing the game to full development.
                    
                    After the allocated project time, all members went to different places for internships, but with the plans of bringing Cara to full development after the internships. During this time, the team worked hard on making everything necessary to pitch to investors and publishers in hopes of getting the game funded and development started. </p>
                    <h5 class="pt-5 text-light text-center">FUTURE</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">We have a lot of goals and dreams for the future of Swift Interactive, our products and the gaming industry as a whole. We obviously can’t share all of this with you but here are the core philosophies we will bring into the company as we grow:

                    One of our main goals outside of making games is making a healthy workplace that can create great games without the use of extensive crunch. Another one of these goals is to expand into a multi-team studio with multiple projects in different stages of development in order to increase job security and minimize layoffs. 
                    
                    In short, we want Swift Interactive to be a place you would be happy to work at for as long as you wanted.</p>
